[#_code_contributions]
== Code Contributions

Donâ€™t push directly to the `main` branch::
- Push your modification to a new branch
- Open a pull request to `main`
- The maintainer of the repository can then merge your modifications into the existing codebase

[#_commit_messages]
== Commit Messages

We use https://spin.atomicobject.com/conventional-commits/[conventional commits]

NOTE: To ensure our guidelines we use xref:SETUP_GUIDE.adoc#_pre_commit_optional[Pre-Commit].
