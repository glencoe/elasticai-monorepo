== Hardware

Based on [.underline]#espressif ESP32-C3-WROOM-02# wifi-module The module is placed on the extension board and connected to the MCU via SPI.

The module currently operates based on the standard espressif binary, which based communication with MCU on the <<_esp_protocol,ESP Protocol>>.

TIP: https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-c3-wroom-02_datasheet_en.pdf[Datasheet]

[#_esp_protocol]
== ESP Protocol

The ESP protocol is a String-based protocol utilizing the <<_at_commands,AT-Command-Set>> to send and receive data.

[#_at_commands]
=== AT-Commands

The https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-at/en/release-v2.2.0.0_esp8266/AT_Command_Set/index.html[AT-Commands] are the core ot the ESP protocol and a small subset used by this network stack can be found under link:atCommands/include/AtCommands.h[AtCommands.h].

[#_wifi_lib]
== Wi-Fi Connection

The wifi library provided under link:wifi/[wifi] provides all required functions to connect to a local wifi network.

To connect to a network, the SSID and Password has to be passed to the library.
The CMake scripts will automatically create a `NetworkConfig.c` inside the link:../../NetworkConfig.c[root folder].
When you want to use wifi capabilities you than have to add the `network_config` library to your source code.

====
.main.c
[source,C]
----
#include "Network.h"

int main (void) {
    //...
    networkConnectToNetwork();
    //...
}
----

.NetworkConfig.c
[source,C]
----
#include "Network.h"

// ...

networkCredentials_t networkCredentials = {
    .ssid = "SSID",
    .password = "PASSWORD"
};

add_executable(my-network-app
    main.c)
target_link_libraries(my-network-app
        ...

        network_lib)
create_enV5_executable(my-network-app)

== HTTP Get

The http library provided under link:http/[http] provides all required functions to execute HTTP-GET requests.

To properly handle the received answer, it is required to register a handle that processes the received HTTP-GET messages from the ESP32 module.
This handler is automatically set when the esp connects to a wifi network via the <<_wifi_lib,wifi library>>.

== MQTT

The mqtt library provided under link:broker/[broker] provides all required functions for a mqtt client that can connect to a Broker.

To properly handle the received answer from the ESP32 module it is required to register a handle that processes the received messages.
This handler is automatically set when the broker connection was successful.

To connect to a broker, the required credentials have to be passed to the library.
The CMake scripts will automatically create a `NetworkConfig.c` inside the link:../../NetworkConfig.c[root folder].
When you want to use mqtt capabilities you than have to add the `network_config` library to your source code.

IMPORTANT: The `clientId` of every device has to be different

.Example

====
.main.c
[source,C]
----
#include "MQTTBroker.h"

char[] brokerDomain = "eip://uni-due.de/es";
char[] clientId = "enV5";

int main (void) {
    //...
    mqttBrokerConnectToBroker(brokerDomain, clientId);
    //...
}
----

.NetworkConfig.c
[source,C]
----
#include "MQTTBroker.h"

// ...

mqttHost_t broker = {
    .ip = "127.0.0.1",
    .port = 1883,
    .userId = "USER",
    .password = "PASSWORD"
};

CAUTION: When MQTT messages are sent to fast to the device, some messages will be dropped!
