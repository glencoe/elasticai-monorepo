== Via Serial Connection (USB)

WARNING: The script is currently not maintained and must be considered *BROKEN*!

CAUTION: The implementation only works on the enV5, **not** the SensorBoard.

The FPGA on the enV5 can be configured by writing a Bit- or Binfile to the flash.
To write a file to the flash, the enV5 needs to be flashed with the correct hardware test link:{src-dir}/test/hardware/TestConfiguration/HardwaretestConfigureViaUSB.c[hardware-test_configUSB].
Place the Binfile you want to send to the enV5 under link:{src-dir}/bitfile_scripts/bitfiles/[bitfile_scripts/bitfiles] and execute the link:{src-dir}/bitfile_scripts/BitfileFlasher.py[BitfileFlasher.py] python script with the required arguments:

[source,bash]
----
python BitfileFlasher.py \
    --port <device_serial_port> \ # <1>
    [--baudrate <serial_baudrate>] \ # <2>
    <path_to_bitfile> \ # <3>
    <start_flash_address> # <4>
----

<1> Serial-Port of the device
<2> Baudrate of serial connection
<3> Path to bitfile
<4> Start address of the flash, where the bitfile should be written to

The python script will send the Bitfile over the serial connection to the enV5.
To configure the FPGA with the new Bitfile, the FPGA has to be resetted.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The FPGA will always reconfigure from address 0x000000 of the flash.
The hardware test executable can be used for this by sending the character `f`/`F` via minicom to the device.
This will trigger a restart of the FPGA.

== Via HTTPGet

The FPGA on the enV5 can be configured by writing a Binfile to the flash.
This can be archived by utilizing the ESP32 WiFi-module on the extension board.
If you want to use the WiFi-module, you have to flash the link:{src-dir}/test/hardware/TestConfiguration/HardwaretestConfigureViaHTTP.c[hardware-test_configHTTP] to the MCU.

TIP: You have to adjust the SSID and Password according to your Network credentials!

Afterward, you must start the corresponding webserver stat provides the server.
For test purposes, a simple webserver can be started by executing link:{src-dir}/bitfile_scripts/HW-Test_Webserver.py[HW-Test_Webserver.py].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The FPGA will always reconfigure from address 0x000000 of the flash.
The hardware test executable can be used for this by sending the character `f`/`F` via minicom to the device.
This will trigger a restart of the FPGA.
