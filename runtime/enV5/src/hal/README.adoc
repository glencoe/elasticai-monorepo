= Hardware Abstraction Layer

The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) libraries are meant to bundle all dependencies into the pico-sdk.
This is done to archive independence from the used hardware in other libraries like sensor libraries.

== Pico-SDK

The https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk[pico-sdk] is included as an external dependency to enable sufficient usage of the RP2040 MCU.
It provides simple to use interfaces for the hardware functions provided by the Raspberry MCU.
